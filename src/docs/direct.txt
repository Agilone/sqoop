Direct-mode Imports
-------------------

While the JDBC-based import method used by Sqoop provides it with the
ability to read from a variety of databases using a generic driver, it
is not the most high-performance method available. Sqoop can read from
certain database systems faster by using their built-in export tools.

For example, Sqoop can read from a MySQL database by using the +mysqldump+
tool distributed with MySQL. You can take advantage of this faster
import method by running Sqoop with the +--direct+ argument. This
combined with a connect string that begins with +jdbc:mysql://+ will
inform Sqoop that it should select the faster access method.

If your delimiters exactly match the delimiters used by +mysqldump+,
then Sqoop will use a fast-path that copies the data directly from
+mysqldump+'s output into HDFS. Otherwise, Sqoop will parse +mysqldump+'s
output into fields and transcode them into the user-specified delimiter set.
This incurs additional processing, so performance may suffer.
For convenience, the +--mysql-delimiters+
argument will set all the output delimiters to be consistent with
+mysqldump+'s format.

Sqoop also provides a direct-mode backend for PostgreSQL that uses the
+COPY TO STDOUT+ protocol from +psql+. No specific delimiter set provides
better performance; Sqoop will forward delimiter control arguments to
+psql+.

The "Supported Databases" section provides a full list of database vendors
which have direct-mode support from Sqoop.

When writing to HDFS, direct mode will open a single output file to receive
the results of the import. You can instruct Sqoop to use multiple output
files by using the +--direct-split-size+ argument which takes a size in
bytes. Sqoop will generate files of approximately this size. e.g.,
+--direct-split-size 1000000+ will generate files of approximately 1 MB
each. If compressing the HDFS files with +--compress+, this will allow
subsequent MapReduce programs to use multiple mappers across your data
in parallel.

Tool-specific arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sqoop will generate a set of command-line arguments with which it invokes
the underlying direct-mode tool (e.g., mysqldump). You can specify additional
arguments which should be passed to the tool by passing them to Sqoop
after a single '+-+' argument. e.g.:

----
$ sqoop --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/db --table foo --direct - --lock-tables
----

The +--lock-tables+ argument (and anything else to the right of the +-+ argument)
will be passed directly to mysqldump.
