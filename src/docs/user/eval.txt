+sqoop-eval+
------------


Purpose
~~~~~~~

The +eval+ tool allows users to quickly run simple SQL queries against
a database; results are printed to the console. This allows users to
preview their import queries to ensure they import the data they
expect.

Syntax

$ sqoop eval (generic-args) (eval-args)
$ sqoop-eval (generic-args) (eval-args)

Although the Hadoop generic arguments must preceed any eval arguments,
the eval arguments can be entered in any order with respect to one
another.
